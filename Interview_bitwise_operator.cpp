//belwo 2 only used in c++ not in java :
//1.. if(n&1). --> it will be always true if n is odd. i.e-> we are doing "AND" with the number having lsd as 1
//2.. n= n>>1 -> it will divide n/2
// log10(n) +1  -->Count the number of 
// (n & n-1) ->will always give zero if n is even. i.e -> ((n&(n-1)) ==0) ->true if n is zero,else false.(Check power of two solutin)
//x^0 =x, x^x= 0, x^y = y^x,
